ulined is a InspIRCd-compatible operator helper written in Python.

Discussion IRC channel: #ulined on [AndrewIRC](https://irc.andrewyu.org) 
or ##ulined on [freenode](https://freenode.net).

The main focus of these scripts is to make a InspIRCd-linkable server in Python,
and if the user wants to, add functionality such as anti-spam (not implemented now).

You need to configure InspIRCd to let this server bind. Go to the InspIRCd
documentation for reference.

To configure this program, copy `config.py.example` to `config.py`, and edit it
according to its comments. It should be farily simple
