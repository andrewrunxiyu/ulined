# ulined

(c) andrewyu <andrew@andrewyu.org>

InspIRCd-compatible operator helper written in Python.

The main focus of these scripts is to make a InspIRCd-linkable server in Python,
and if the user wants to, add functionality such as anti-spam (not implemented now).

Just copy `config.py.example` to `config.py` and edit, and run `ulined.py`.
